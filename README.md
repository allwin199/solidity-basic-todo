# Solidity Todo

This is a simple Todo application implemented in Solidity. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete tasks on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Prerequisites

- Solidity compiler (version X.X.X)

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/worksofallwin/solidityBasics.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   cd solidityBasics
   npm install
   ```

3. Deploy the Solidity contract:

   - Compile the contract using your Solidity compiler.
   - Deploy the compiled contract to your Ethereum development environment.

4. Update the contract address:

   - Open `app.js` file.
   - Update the `contractAddress` variable with the deployed contract address.

5. Run the application:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

6. Open your browser and access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
